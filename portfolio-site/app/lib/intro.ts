  "A varied background in Architecture, Graphic Design, Web Development and over 10 years in Product Design, has helped me to become the enthusiastic creative technologist and versatile design leader that I am today.",
  "I’ve helped build ClearScore from 1 million users to over 22 million, and the design team from 3 designers up to 50.",
  "My focus on combining beautiful craft and technology enables me to lead my teams into pushing boundaries on both sides of the product lifecycle, from inception all the way through to a fully functioning product. I have built products serving millions of users across the globe, from engaging native games and chat services, to helping millions tackle their financial worries, all the while mentoring, leading and helping other designers and engineers grow and thrive in their own careers.",
  "Recently, I have had the opportunity to lead on ClearScore’s new Platform initiatives through a refreshed Design System across multiple brands and platforms, a Server-Driven UI framework, and a headless CMS integration. With these new technologies, and other major architectural changes, we have been able to completely rebuild the core features of the ClearScore app within 9 months, which otherwise would have taken years, and millions more in expenditure to build. I have also helped to onboard dozens of designers and other staff in the usage of these tools, including being able to contribute to them themselves.",
